I’m a resilient, energetic and strong leader with a passion for improving our college in any way I can.\n\nKimberley College should be a place where all can prosper in whatever field they wish to pursue, and where they can discover the pathway that is right for them. Too many people propose unfeasible and unhelpful suggestions, which is why my manifesto is about realistic change to help everyone.\n\nI hope you enjoy browsing this website that we spent a lot of time working on, and I'd love to hear your thoughts/suggestions about my policy using my Instagram (@VoteNick2021) or my email (hello@nickforpresident.co.uk)."
