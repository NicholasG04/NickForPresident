That's why, as College President, I would create a targeted peer support system in which students that are confident on topics within their A Level subjects can help those that are in need of support throughout their course. This has already proven to be successful by the Mathematics Department, who created \"Maths Mates\" earlier on this year which has helped to boost many students' grades and, moreover, confidence. \n\nThis program could be run by the Student Ambassadors for each subject, as well as being overseen by teachers so that students can be effectively paired with those that can help them most. For those who take full advantage of this opportunity, there are great possibilities as to how successful this can be."
