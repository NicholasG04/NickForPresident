That's why I love Microsoft Teams - a platform in which one can share ideas, discover new opportunities and get support when they need it. The Mathematics Department makes great use of Microsoft Teams - they share extra curricular activites, have a record of what we did in each lesson for students not in college, and a channel where students can ask questions for others to help with. This is really successful, and has proven invaluable for us. One feature I particularly like is the vast, organised bank of revision resources which certainly helped me to succeed in my Mathematics A Level this year. Being so easy to access and trivial to find questions on the topic you're looking for, I know they have had a large impact on all students in my class.\n\nFurthermore, I would like to cease the use of satchel:one in favour of Microsoft Teams for homework, as many students have told me that they find it more difficult to keep track of what homework they have when it is spread across the two platforms. Consolidating this onto Microsoft Teams would, I believe, provide a better user experience and reduce the unnecessary stress caused by forgetting to check one platform or the other."
