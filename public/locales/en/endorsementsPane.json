    "kane": "Mr Kane - &quot;Nick Gregory is a man of the people! Never before have I met a student with the perfect balance of intelligence, leadership and charisma - a winning combination to represent the views of students at Kimberley College. Nick has continually showed his passion for Politics and masterminded the successful Labour campaign in the 2020 student elections. Nick has also been involved in every aspect of student leadership and will work collaboratively with others to ensure that the views of all people are represented Nick is the only logical choice. If you want someone who will fight for what is right and genuinely care about the experiences of all students then a vote for Nick is the only option. Don&apos;t be thick - vote for Nick.&quot;"
